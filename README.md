# Sensor Data Transmission using 6LoWPAN on RIOT OS

## Overview
This project demonstrates low-power sensor data acquisition and transmission
using RIOT OS on Zolertia Remote Rev-A boards. The system uses IPv6 over 6LoWPAN
and GNRC networking for efficient IoT communication.

## Hardware
- Zolertia Remote Rev-A (CC2538, ARM Cortex-M3)
- Zolertia Orion Gateway
- LDR Sensor

## Features
- ADC-based LDR sensor reading
- IPv6 communication over 6LoWPAN
- GNRC Border Router configuration
- UDP-based networking
- Shell-based debugging

## Technologies Used
- RIOT OS
- 6LoWPAN
- IEEE 802.15.4
- GNRC Networking Stack

## Applications
- Smart agriculture
- Smart cities
- Environmental monitoring
